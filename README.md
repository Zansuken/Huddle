## My process

- Analyzing how to structure the HTML -> Stylizing the different parts of the project -> Adding hovers stylized -> Testing everytime a new featuer is implemented
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Transition and transform properties animations on hover and more for the CSS part.

### Continued development

Probably better looking and more accuracy in animations that I could do in the future
